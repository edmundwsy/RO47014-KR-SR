Hi! You can list your order here. We will take care of picking it from the store. 

How to use this: simply type your list one product for each line, starting with a dot "." from the available list. 
The available products are 5: hageslag, tomataten blockjes, banana, melk, applesientje. The box1 and box2 are products in simulation.

Example, my grocery is:
.hageslag_sim

Update the list above with your order, and enjoy TIAGo filling the basket!
